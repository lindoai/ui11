- **Update progress percentages** in the progress tracking section
- **Commit progress** regularly to maintain accurate tracking
- **Review tasks.md** before starting new work to see current status

### 7. Tailwind CSS Watcher Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Always restart dev server** after completing any task or creating new files
- **Verify Tailwind compilation** - Check that all new classes are available in browser
- **Monitor content paths** - Ensure tailwind.config.js includes all file types and directories
- **Test new classes immediately** - Verify p-3, animate-spin, custom colors work as expected
- **Fix compilation issues immediately** - Don't proceed if styles aren't loading
- **Update content array** when adding new file types or directories
- **Run `npm run dev` after any significant changes** to ensure CSS is regenerated

### 8. Dark Mode Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Universal dark mode** - Every element must have dark mode classes
- **Theme toggle everywhere** - Dark/light toggle must work on all pages
- **Consistent dark palette** - Use same dark colors across all elements
- **System preference detection** - Respect OS dark mode setting
- **Manual override** - Allow users to manually switch themes

### 8. HTML Code Validation Rules (CRITICAL)
- **HTML tab must match preview exactly** - Code in HTML tabs must generate identical components to what's shown in preview
- **Complete functional code** - HTML tab should contain all necessary classes, attributes, and structure
- **Copy-paste ready** - Users should be able to copy HTML and get working components immediately
- **All variations included** - Every component shown in preview must have corresponding HTML code
- **Accurate representation** - No simplified or incomplete code examples
- **Test before publishing** - Verify HTML code actually produces the preview result
- **Update both simultaneously** - When changing preview, immediately update HTML tab to match

## üéØ Core Rules

### 1. Build Order
1. **Atomic elements first** (button, input, text)
2. **Components second** (use atomic elements)
3. **Blocks last** (use both atomic + components)

### 2. Consistency Rules

- **Same behavior patterns** (hover, focus, active)
- **Same naming convention** (BEM or utility classes)

### 3. File Rules
- **One folder per element** (button/, card/, hero/)
- **Demo in index.html** (show all variations)
- **Behavior in element.js** (if needed)
- **Documentation in README.md**

### 4. Code Rules

- **No dependencies** (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Semantic HTML** (proper tags)
- **TAILWIND ONLY** - Never write custom CSS, only use Tailwind classes
- **No style attributes** - All styling through Tailwind utility classes

### 5. Development Rules
- **Build one complete** before starting next
- **Test each variation** before moving on
- **Keep it simple** - avoid complexity
- **Document everything** as you build

### 6. Tailwind CSS Watcher Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Always restart dev server** after completing any task or creating new files
- **Verify compilation immediately** - Test that all new classes work in browser
